This repository is a collection of my notes and experiments learning nmigen.

To install the required dependencies I:
- installed fomu toolchain
- made a python3 virtual environment and installed the following
  - nmigen (from pip)
  - nmigen_boards (from github, pip version doesn't appear to have fomu_pvt)
